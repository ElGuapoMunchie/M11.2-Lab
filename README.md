# Web Dev Starter Code

## Overview

Represents a sample inventory app interface created with `html`, `css`, `JavaScript`, and `Amazon AWS` + database connection capabilities.

Functionality includes a `Refresh` button (reload the page), and an input form where items can be added to the database.

## Compiling and Running the Program
First, clone the repository to a new directory on your computer.

Then, you can run the program in one of the following ways:
- Open the code in `VSCode`, and with the `LivePreview` extension installed, open the `index.html` file with LivePreview (click `Show Preview` in the upper-right corner).

- Open the site in your browser using `localhost:3000`
